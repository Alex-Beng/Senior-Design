This MATLAB script uses the Time-Difference-of-Arrival (TDOA) technique to determine the location of an isotropic point
source. Four sensors were used in a square geometric configuration. A cartesian co-ordinate system was used and the origin
was centered on the 1st sensor.

Since all sensors are located in the same plane, an ambiguity arises when determining the x-coordinate of the location of the
source. Imagine that the source is infinitesimally small emanating SINE waves in all directions. If we just consider the
crests of the SINE waves then we can draw concentric circles centered on the source emanating outward. These circles will
increase in radius as time increases and they will be spaced equally apart by a distance exactly equal to one wavelength. 

It's critically important that the sensors be spaced strictly less than half a wavelength apart. Visualize the concentric
circles (crests of the SINE waves) emanating outward from the source. If the sensors are spaced far apart from one another
then there will be several crests between the sensors which is bad. When the sensors sample, there is no way for us to
determine the peak-of-interest (POI). The POI is the feature we will be looking at later on to help us determine the time
delay between channels 2,3, and 4 using channel 1 as the reference.
